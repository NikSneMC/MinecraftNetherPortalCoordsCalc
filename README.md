### This is very basic program that calculates portal coordinates in other dimension
I made it for fun and my commit history XD

### Usage
1. Stand on the top of one of the portal blocks
2. Aim this block
3. Press F3 + C
4. Open your terminal
5. Execute `python calc.py {destination dimention, nether|overworld} {coordinates that you've copied earlier}`
6. Profit!

P.S. I don't think that's serious project. Good luck with your portals!
